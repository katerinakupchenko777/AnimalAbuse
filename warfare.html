				<div id='b_t'>
					<p> Animals have been common in warfare and it is one of the forms of cruelty because the animals end up getting killed in the end. Some examples of animals that have been used in warfare are horses, dogs, dolphins, birds, pigs, oxen, camels, rats and elephants.These animals have been used in dangerous situations in war.  These situations include transport, bomb detection and also directly involved with harming the enemy. The military people train these animal to become better at the job. In result thousands of live animals are shot, stabbed, mutilated, and killed in cruel military training exercises. Violent military exercises continue through the U.S and this is a big problem. The more we stop this cruelty the better it would be for the animals.
Slogan: Animals are not meant for fighting, they are meant to be loved.
