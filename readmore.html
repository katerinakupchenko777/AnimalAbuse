<h2>Abandonment</h2>
<p>Every year a large number of pets get abandoned from their owners due to people moving out. 
Reason why people abandoned their pets because moving out of state <br> and can't take the pet or new
landlord doesn't allow pets or no space in new home for the pet.<br> Most people throw out their pet 
because of behavior shown in pet like biting or aggression in dogs, pets don't get along with other animals, 
dog needs to much attention or cat isn't friendly enough. </p>
