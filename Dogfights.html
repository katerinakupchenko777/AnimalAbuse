<p><br><br> Dog fighting is an illegal activity as it should be. It is impossible to know how many people get involved in dog fighting. <br> Dog fighting is when two dogs are forced to fight in a ring until one of the two stand down. Most people find this as a form of  ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù but it‚Äôs actually a form of abuse. <br> It‚Äôs one of the most heinous forms of animal cruelty. These dogs mostly live in isolation, so it means that live with short heavy chains around their neck. Dogs regularly fight through the use of drugs. These dogs get injected with steroids to enhance muscle mass and encourage aggression. <br> They get their ears cropped and tails docked close to their bodies. This makes the animal body smaller and limits areas that another dog can grab during the fight.</p>

				<p> <br> Even though dog fighting is illegal in all 50 states, it still goes on when it should not. This leads to at least 16,000 dogs killed a year. Dogfighting is associated <br> with other forms of criminal activity including illegal gambling and possession of drugs and firearms. The main breed of dog that is used to fighting is pitbulls. <br> This does not mean that pit bulls are not suitable for pets. It would be great if people would stop dog fighting. How would you feel if you were one of theses dogs and was <br> forced to fight? Please help and save the dogs today.
